Regarding the Activity model, I am not sure why the last three fields were in their own array
ie. output['area_cleared_sqm', 'num_deminers', 'minutes_worked']
if they should have had their own linked model ?

I added a minify package called renatomarinho/laravel-page-speed that I'd really recommend because it makes the site load a lot smoother and run a lot faster in your browser and would a make a huge difference if you have a slow internet connection

Instructions for installation :

git clone https://github.com/alexwindsor/halotest1.git

make a mysql database called halotest2

edit .env file with your login credentials

php artisan migrate --seed

php artisan serve
